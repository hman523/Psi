Psi is a brand new langauge. It is statically typed, compiled,
and lexically scoped. It is a playground for me to mess around
with new ideas. The language is very unstable and features
will (hopefully) change frequently.

## Effects
One unique thing about Psi is the separation of effetcts. When
declaring a function, you must determine if the function is 
pure or not. This can be verified by the compiler and will 
allow for some built in compiler optimizations.
